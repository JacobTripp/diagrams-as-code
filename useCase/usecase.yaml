  name: Use Case
  description: >-
    A use case is a situation where your system is used to fulfill one or more
    of your customer's requirements; a use case captures a piece of
    functionality that the system provides.
    Use cases are the starting point of your model since they affect and guide
    all the other elements within your system's design. They describe a system's
    requirements strictly from the outside looking in; They specify the value
    that the system delivers to customers.

  - name: Use Case
    Description: >-
      Use cases must have clear pass/fail criteria. A use case, or job, might
      be as simple as allowing the user the log in or as complex as executing a
      distributed transaction across multiple global databases.
      The important thing to remember is that a use case, from the user's
      perspective, is a complete use of the system; there is some interaction
      with the system, as well as some output from that interaction. An example
      use case could be 'Create a new customer account'.

  - name: Actor
    Description: >-
      An actor interacts with the system and is not part of the system.
      Actors don't have to be actual people. While an actor might be a person,
      it could also be a third party's system, such as in a
      business-to-business application. Think of an actor as a black box, you
      cannot change an actor and you are not interested in how it works, but
      it must interact with your system. Sometimes identifying an actor can be
      tricky, here are a couple questions that might help identify if you have
      an actor or not; Is the 'thing' an actual person interacting with the
      system? Is the 'thing' something that I can change within the system's
      design?
      If you answered 'Yes' to the first, you probably have an actor. If you
      answered 'No' to the second question you probably have an Actor.
      Don't for get to include auditors, installers, maintainers, and so on. If
      you focus on only the obvious users of your system, then you might forget
      about some of these other stakeholders.
      Some actors are just a special kind of another actor. For example,
      FooActor can do everything that BarActor can do but with a couple
      additional interactions with the system. Use a generalization arrow to
      show this.

  - name: Communication
    description: >-
      A communication line connects and actor and a use case to show the actor
      participating in the use case. There is a potential to have any number of
      actors involved in a use case, there is no real limit.
      The purpose of a communication line is to show that an actor is simply
      involved in a use case, not to imply an information exchange in any
      particular direction or that the actor starts the use case. That type of
      information can be added to the use case's description.

  - name: Includes
    description: >-
      When there is repetitive behavior shared between two use cases then that
      behavior is best separated and captured within a new use case. This new
      use case can then be reused by other use cases using and include
      relationship. For example if two use cases need to check a credential
      database (that's an actor) then a new use case of 'Check Identity' should
      be created and then any use case that needs to check identity then
      includes that use case.
      The include relationship declares that the use case including the other
      completely reuses all of the steps from the use case being included.

  - name: Generalizaion
    description: >-
      Sometimes there are use cases whose behavior can be applied to several
      different cases, but with small changes. Unlike the include relationship
      that uses everything as is without changes, this relationship allows you
      to reuse a subset of behavior with small changes for a collection of
      specific situations. In object-oriented terms, you have a number of
      specialized cases of a generalized use case.
      For example, currently you have a 'Create Account' use case but what if
      you want to have different types of accounts that differ slightly from
      each other? You would want to describe the general behavior use case of
      'Create Account' and then define specialized use cases in which the
      account being created is a specific type, such as a regular account or a
      management account.
      By using inheritance, you are saying that every step in the general use
      case must occur in the specialized use case.
